# Real_vs_Fake-face-image-Detection-

This dataset consists of all 70k REAL faces from the Flickr dataset collected by Nvidia, as well as 70k fake faces sampled from the 1 Million FAKE faces (generated by StyleGAN) that was provided by Bojan.

In this dataset, I convenient combined both dataset, resized all the images into 256px, and split the data into train, validation and test set. I also included some CSV files for convenience.
